Hey Jude, don't make it bad
Take a sad song and make it better
Remember to let her into your heart
Then you can start to make it better

Hey Jude, don't be afraid
You were made to go out and get her
The minute you let her under your skin
Then you begin to make it better

And anytime you feel the pain, hey Jude, refrain
Don't carry the world upon your shoulders
For well you know that it's a fool who plays it cool
By making his world a little colder

Na, na, na, naa-naa
Na, na, naa-naa

Hey Jude, don't let me down

You have found her, now go and get her (let it out and let it in)
Remember to let her into your heart
Then you can start to make it better

So let it out and let it in, hey Jude, begin
You're waiting for someone to perform with
And don't you know that it's just you, hey Jude, you'll do
The movement you need is on your shoulder

Na, na, na, naa-naa
Na, na, naa-naa, yeah

Hey Jude, don't make it bad
Take a sad song and make it better
Remember to let her under your skin
Then you'll begin to make it

Better, better, better, better, better, better, oh yeah!

Na, na, na, na-na-na-naa (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Na-na-na-naa, hey, Jude

Na, na, na, na-na-na-naa
Na-na-na-naa, hey, Jude

Na, na, na, na-na-na-naa

Na, na, na, na-na-na-naa
Na-na-na-naa, hey, Jude (Jude, Jude, a Jude, a Jude, a Juda-Judey)

Na, na, na, na-na-na-naa
Na-na-na-naa, hey, Jude (Jude, Jude, Jude, Jude, Jude)
Na, na, na, na-na-na-naa
Na-na-na-naa, hey, Jude

Hey, you know you can make it, Jude, Jude, you're not gonna break it

Na, na, na, na-na-na-naa (don't make it bad, Jude)
Take a sad song and make it better
Na-na-na-naa, hey, Jude (Jude)
Hey Jude, woah!
Na, na, na, na-na-na-naa (Jude)
Na-na-na-naa, hey, Jude (yeah, hey, hey, hey, hey)
